      <p>Hello everyone!</p>
      <p>I hope you are fine.</p>
      <p>I am very happy to be among you!</p>
      <p>I am currently working as a customer representative.
         I am doing this class to get a certificate in web and computer programming to change my career.
      And to start working as a programmer.
      Additionally, I would like to be a software developer because I see a lot of opportunities there if I really develop my coding skills.
      Some of my hobbies are going to the gym, listening to music and watching movies.</p> 

     <p>Fortunately and unfortunately, I am still single.</p>

     <p>I am not a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints yet. But that cannot prevent me from visiting and having friends there!
     A quote that I have learned from one of our gathering devotionals is finish what you have started. This is  really inspiring to me.</p>

     <p> I am looking forward to working with you, devoted people!</p>
