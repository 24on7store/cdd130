  </header>
   <p>Welcome on board and congratulations making that smart choice to join us.
    Without furthering, let me share some of the best benefits ever you have.
    A- Education: There is an education program that allows every eligible member to choose a path
    among 11 paths. The true name of this benefit is PATHWAYS.
    You can choose your first path according to your expectations and the field in which you have been working.
     Of course, you will be able to choose another path right after completing one.
    B- Mentorship: there is a mentorship program, that means, you will be mentored by a high-caliber-experienced Toastmaster for free.
    These are some highlights of a mentor; Assist you in your projects, share some strategies with you, help you sharpen your skills,
    motivate you and encourage you to keep going to be a very professional speaker and leader! All I have mentioned above are for free,
